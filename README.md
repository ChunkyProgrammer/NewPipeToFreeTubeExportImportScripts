# New-Pipe To Free-Tube Export/Import Scripts
Export Data From New Pipe To Free Tube

Currently this is a jupyter notebook you can change too your liking

# What Works: 
- Import subscriptions (without thumbnails)

# What Sort Of Works (With Work Arounds/Stipulations)
- Importing Plaulists (Free Tube's playlist feature does not seem fully implemented, so playlists keep getting deleted [though this may be something I am doing wrong], but you can pick one playlist too add, just send it too the bottom of the JSON file before starting Free Tube)
- Getting Thumbnails sorta... does not work (currently you can do this by going through channels and subscribing/unsubscribing, Free Tube will fetch the Thumbnail)

# TODO: 
 - Get JSON exporting to export an acceptable format
 - Reflect New Pipe subscription groups in Free Tube "profiles"
 - Figure out why playlists keep getting deleted (this may be on Free Tube's end, the feature does not seem fully implemented, but you can pick one playlist too add, just send it too the bottom of the JSON file before starting Free Tube)
- Fetch YouTube Thumbnains for subscriptions (currently you can do this by going through channels and subscribing/unsubscribing, Free Tube will fetch the Thumbnail)
- Add subbort for LBRY app or anything Odysee may support
- Make this a nice command line script where things can be done with options rather than code
- UI?
- Bi-directional?

This is just sort of a hacky work around until these features are more fully supported. No gaurentee of an update.
